Checker Framework Inference README
==================================

This project aims to provide a general type inference framework
for the Checker Framework.

All suggestions for improvements are very welcome!

If you want to extend the framework for your own type system or add
additional constraint solvers, please send us mail.

The checker-framework-inference Google Drive folder contains
additional documents for developers:

That information is being moved to here in the repository.


Requirements
------------

You will need a JDK and gradle.
I usually use OpenJDK 7.

Install the source-versions of these three tools:

http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/annotation-file-utilities/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/

You'll need `CHECKERFRAMEWORK`, `JSR308`, `JAVA_HOME`, and `AFU`
environment variables set up appropriately.

`insert-annotations-to-source` (from `$AFU/scripts`) must be on your path.

Make sure that all tools are compiled correctly and that all Checker
Framework test cases work.

NOTE: gradle on Ubuntu 14.10 hard-codes JAVA_HOME. To change this, edit
    `/usr/share/gradle/bin/gradle`
and replace

````
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
````

with

````
    [ -n "$JAVA_HOME" ] || export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
````


Building
--------

To build:

````
gradle dist
````


Execution
---------

Verify you have all of the requirements.

````
./scripts/inference
````

is the script used to run inference.

Example:

````
./scripts/inference --log-level FINE --mode ROUNDTRIP --checker ostrusted.OsTrustedChecker --solver checkers.inference.solver.PropagationSolver -afud /path/to/Annotation/File/Utilities/output/directory [List of files]
````

There are a couple of required options:

* `--mode`
Specifies what the tools should do.
Available options are [INFER, TYPECHECK, ROUNDTRIP, ROUNDTRIP_TYPECHECK]

  * `INFER`:
    Generates and solves the constraints and writes the results to default.jaif file

  * `TYPECHECK`:
    Typechecks the existin code

  * `ROUNDTRIP`:
    Generates and solves the constraints and then inserts the results
    back into the original source code

  * `ROUNDTRIP_TYPECHECK`:
    Executes roundtrip and then typechecks the result

* `--checker`
Specifies which checker to run.
The two most supported checkers at the moment are
`checkers.ostrusted.OsTrustedChecker` and
`checkers.tainting.TaintingChecker`

* `--solver`
Which solver to use on the constraints.

* `--targetclasspath`
The classpath that is required by target program.

`checkers.inference.solver.PropagationSolver` and `checkers.inference.solver.GeneralSolver` are real solvers
at the moment.

Omiting the solver will create an output that numbers all of the
annotation positions in the program.

`checkers.inference.solver.DebugSolver` will output all of the
constraints generated.


Other options can be found by `./scripts/inference --help`.

## Use of Generic solver

Generic solver is designed for solving type constraints from arbitrary type system.

You can invoke generic solver through:

````
--solver checkers.inference.solver.GeneralSolver
````

There are a couple of arguments that generic solver can accept:

* `backEndType`
Specifies what back end is going to use. 

  At this moment, there are three available back ends:

  * `MaxSAT`: Encodes constraints as Max-SAT problem and use Sat4j library to solve.

  * `Lingeling`: Encodes constraints as SAT problem and use Lingeling solver to solve.
  
  * `LogiQL`: Encodes constraints as statements of LogiQL language and use LogicBlox to solve.
  
  `MaxSAT` back end is used by default.

* `useGraph`
Specifies whether to separate constraints into multiple components through constraint graph and solve them respectively. The default value is true.

* `solveInParallel`
If constraints are separated by constraint graph, this arguments indicates whether to solve the components in parallel (multithreading). The default value is true. 

* `collectStatistic`
Specifies whether to collect statistic with respect to timing, size of constraints, size of encoding, etc. The default value is false.

For example, generic solver can be invoked through following command:

````
./scripts/inference --log-level FINE --mode ROUNDTRIP --checker ostrusted.OsTrustedChecker --solver checkers.inference.solver.GeneralSolver --solverArgs backEndType=MaxSat,useGraph=true,collectStatistic=true,solveInParallel=false -afud /path/to/Annotation/File/Utilities/output/directory [List of files]
````
