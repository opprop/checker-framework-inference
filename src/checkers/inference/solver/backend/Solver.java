/**
 * Solver adapts a concrete underlying solver, e.g. Sat4j, LogiQL, Z3, etc.
 * This class is the super class for all concrete Solver sub-classes.
 * For each concrete Solver, it adapts the type constraint solving process to
 * the underlying solver implementation.
 *
 * A Solver takes type constraints from {@link checkers.inference.solver.SolverEngine}},
 * then delegates solving constraints responsibility to the underlying solver, and transform
 * underlying solver solution as a map between an integer and an annotation mirror as
 * the inferred result.
 *
 * Method {@link #solve()} is responsible for coordinating
 * above steps.
 *
 * {@link #solve()} method is the entry point of the solver adapter, and it is got
 * called in class {@link checkers.inference.solver.SolverEngine}}. See
 * {@link checkers.inference.solver.SolverEngine#solveInparall()} and
 * {@link checkers.inference.solver.SolverEngine#solveInSequential()}.
